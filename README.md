# Challenge3

Challeneg 3 was to generate a random password for the user, not entering or entering the wrong criterias gets you the correct invald alerts, prompt to enter characters in between 8-128 works, prompts asking for lower case, upper case, numbers and special characters work, and when all prompts are answered the user will get the randomized password they desire.

## resources

Most of the codes I used in this challenge came from what we learned in last week's classses and deconstructing the pig-latin example's 
javascript code to see how certain things worked and just translated that into my own code
